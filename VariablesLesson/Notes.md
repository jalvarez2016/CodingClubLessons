## `//`

In javascript, this is how we start a comment that the computer will ignore when reading the code.

## `;`

In Javascript, this is optional (unless your boss tell you to include it) but it basically marks the end of that line of code.
In some cases, there might be some tools in place that will throw errors if it is not included, usually this is tool will be a linter.
